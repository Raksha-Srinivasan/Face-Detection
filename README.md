# Face-Detection

This project mainly aims in detecting the face using classifier available in OpenCV.

# Haar Cascade classifier is used here to analyze pixels in the image into squares by functions.This uses "Integral Image" concepts to compute the "Features" Detected.

# ->Haar Cascades uses the Adaboost learning algorithm which selects a small number of important features from a large set to give n efficient result of classifiers.


# Module to be installed:
<b>1.pip install openCV-python</b>
