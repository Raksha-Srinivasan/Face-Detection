# Face-Detection

This project mainly aims in detecting the face using classifier available in OpenCV.

Haar Cascade classifier is used here to analyze pixels in the image into squares by functions.This uses "Integral Image" concepts to compute the "Features" Detected.

->Haar Cascades uses the Adaboost learning algorithm which selects a small number of important features from a large set to give n efficient result of classifiers.
